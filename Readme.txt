This is primarily oriented around the Neural Net class (found in src/NN).
The import/export classes are for handling training data and visualizing output data.
The matrix class (in src/math) is used for various math functions involved in the structure of Neural Nets, as well as storing the weights and bases.

In training.txt, I have the coordinates (as sample input) and RGB values (as sample output) of each pixel in Van Gogh's famous painting, Starry Night.
Once the neural net has trained and learned from the input data, it is able to output a full image (In the currently commented line 38 of main.cpp)
to the file "out.txt". Using the Processing program found in the Converter file, one can visualize the image stored in the out.txt file generated by the NN.

I plan on improving the overall algorithm used for training (Better spot training, better delta values, etc) in the future, as well as likely multithreading the training.
